# The Journey of Building MI Cubed Lab: From Aspiration to the Vietnamese AI Community

Welcome to MI Cubed Lab!

Amidst the vibrant and promising landscape of artificial intelligence in Vietnam, we proudly launch MI Cubed Lab with a grand aspiration: to become a dedicated space for in-depth learning, cutting-edge research, and a thriving community of technology enthusiasts.

MI Cubed Lab (Machine Intelligence Cubed) is more than just a name. "MI" represents Machine Intelligence, the very core of our pursuits. And "Cubed" embodies a tale of relentless efforts, challenges overcome, and the ambition to reach significant achievements in the future. Furthermore, the number 3 in "Cubed" also symbolizes the powerful synergy between our three primary research areas: Machine Learning, Quantum Computing, and Optimization.

At MI Cubed Lab, we focus on exploring and sharing knowledge in three pivotal domains: Machine Learning, Quantum Computing, and Optimization. We believe that a deep understanding of the theoretical foundations and the ability to implement algorithms from scratch are key to truly mastering technology.

# What can you expect from MI Cubed Lab?

We will take you on a journey to uncover the "secrets" behind leading research papers. We won't just summarize content; instead, we will:

- Explain mathematical formulas thoroughly: Helping you understand their meaning and how they work.
- Provide in-depth analysis and concrete examples: So you can grasp how to apply theory in practice.
- Guide you through implementation from scratch: Offering detailed steps and code samples so you can build AI models yourself, without solely relying on existing frameworks.
- Share ideas for development and expansion: Based on existing research, we will collectively explore new and potential directions.

This journey is led by [You can add a short sentence introducing yourself here, for example: "an AI Engineer with a deep passion for research and a desire to contribute to the community."]. We believe that by sharing knowledge openly and accessibly, we can collectively build an increasingly strong AI community in Vietnam that makes significant contributions to the world.
